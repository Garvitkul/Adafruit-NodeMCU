*This is a NodeMCU base IoT project using Adafruit.*

We have made an account on Adafruit.io cloud and then created two feeds of On/Off and then these feeds sends the On/Off commands to the NodeMCU to turn On/Off the relay connected to the NodeMCU.
Now we can connect anything to the relay so that whenever we turn On/Off the relay using the cloud, the appliance attached to it, starts or stops. 
We have attached a motor to it so that it can move or stop.



**Steps**
- Create an account of Adafruit.io Cloud.
- Create Dashboard.
- Create two feeds for On/Off.
- Copy the Username and Key of Adafruit.io account.
- Connect Relay Module to NodeMCU pin 4.
- Connect NodeMCU to computer.
- Upload the Code.
- Connect any actuator or appliance to the relay.
- Test the system by turning On/Off the appliance by cloud.
